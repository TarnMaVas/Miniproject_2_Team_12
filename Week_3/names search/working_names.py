    Takes a file and returns a tuple based on it:
    - The first element of the tuple is a set of the 3 most popular names.
    - The second element is a tuple containing:
        - The number of names used only once.
        - A set of those unique names.

        - The most popular first letter (with the most different names).
        - The set of names starting with that letter.
        - The total number of children named with those names.
